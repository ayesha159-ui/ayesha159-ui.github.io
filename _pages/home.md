I fell in love with programming and software development, and I’ve been on a continuous journey to build, learn, and grow as an engineer.

I am fluent in languages like Python and JavaScript, with experience in frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Express.

My field of interest lies in developing full-stack applications, designing scalable backend systems, and solving real-world problems through code.

Whenever possible, I apply my skills by building responsive web apps, automating workflows, and contributing to open-source projects that have real impact.
