I am Postdoc Researcher in Hassan Masoud lab at Mechanical Engineering Department at Clemson University. Here, I am working on modeling and simulation of Marangoni surfing. Before that I was workng at Anna Balazs lab at University of Pittsburgh, Department of Chemical Engineering. My work at Pitt involved computer modeling of buoyancy-driven flows in a micro-chamber as a result of adding chemical reagents to react with enzyme-coated elastic micro-posts. We showed that how these chemo-hydro-mechanical feedback affects interactions in biomimetic array of anchored elastic micro-posts to generate regular, self-organized dynamical patterns as well as different modes of motion.
